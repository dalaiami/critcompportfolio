        Description

      <p>
        A frankenstein of lines and styles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story for the first figure (head):
        <br />They go to work, wait, and watch. <br />The day passes, months
        pass the same. <br />Their color fades, as time drifts. <br />They were
        left behind. <br />Bright orange to dull yellow, the sun won.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story for the second figure (upper body - from Yiqing):
        <br />
        Struggling with life. <br />
        Doing absolutely nothing but stay home, watch TV, and eat pizza.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story for the third figure (lower body - from Lauria):
        <br />Frederic was born on a plane in the hours of the day lost between
        time zones. <br />A solid foundation of cabbage and acute hearing has
        taken him far in life. <br />He works as a curator of garden art and has
        organized shows at some of the fanciest gardens in the world.
      </p>

        They were strangers, until they weren't.

      <p>
        My group and I drew our characters and then spliced and combined their
        bodies. I used PNGs, and then added a mouse effect.

      <p>
        This figure is a combination of coneboy, a homebody, and a cryptic
        figure with cabbage feet.
